# Who is a pentester?

A pentester, or penetration tester, is an individual who identifies security flaws within a network or system. They are often external consultants, authorized by a company to perform security audits on their IT ecosystem, and identify any potential cybersecurity risks. Normally, a pentester begins by conducting reconnaissance on their clientâ€™s systems, looking for any potential vulnerabilities. Then, they try to infiltrate the systems by exploiting these vulnerabilities, and eventually gain access to critical data.
