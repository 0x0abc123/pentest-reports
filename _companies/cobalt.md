Cobalt was founded on the belief that pentesting can be better. We pioneered the Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) space – you could even say we wrote the book on it – by pairing a SaaS platform with an exclusive community of highly vetted testers to disrupt the old school way of testing. Today, over 1,000 customers use Cobalt to run pentests that start faster, produce stronger results, and integrate with modern development cycles.

We’re an award-winning (and fully remote) workplace with Scandinavian roots, an American base, and a global outlook. Together, we’re committed to helping agile teams remediate risk quickly and innovate securely.
